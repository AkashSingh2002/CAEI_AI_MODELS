Report on Audio Classification Model

Purpose:
The purpose of this audio classification model is to classify audio files into different classes based on their features extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).

Components:
1.Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The code loads audio files from the UrbanSound8K dataset and extracts MFCC features from each audio file.
   - MFCC features are scaled and prepared for model prediction.

2.Feature Extraction**:
   - MFCC features are extracted from audio files using the librosa library.
   - These features serve as input to the machine learning model for classification.

3.Model Architecture**:
   - The model architecture consists of multiple dense layers with activation functions like ReLU.
   - Dropout layers are included to prevent overfitting.
   - The final layer uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.

4.Model Training**:
   - The model is trained using the extracted MFCC features and their corresponding class labels.
   - Model training involves specifying the number of epochs, batch size, loss function, and optimizer.
   - Checkpoints are used to save the best model during training based on validation accuracy.

5.Model Evaluation**:
   - The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its accuracy.
   - The evaluation results are printed to assess the performance of the model.

6.Inference**:
   - MFCC features are extracted from a sample audio file.
   - The trained model predicts the class labels for the given audio features.
   - Predicted class labels are inverse transformed to obtain the class names.

Conclusion:
The audio classification model demonstrates an effective approach to classify audio files into different categories using machine learning techniques. By extracting MFCC features and training a deep learning model, the system achieves reasonable accuracy in classifying audio samples from the UrbanSound8K dataset.

Recommendations:
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Explore techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance model robustness.
- Consider deploying the model in real-world applications for audio classification tasks.

Note:
- Ensure that all required libraries such as librosa, tensorflow, and numpy are installed.
- Provide the correct file paths for loading audio files and dataset metadata.
- Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture based on specific requirements and constraints.
